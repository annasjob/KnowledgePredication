<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Markers associated with the dimensions of
knowledge predication</h1>

</div>


<p>In chapter 9 of <em>Knowledge predication</em>, I use the markers
associated with the dimensions of the CMDS analysis of the extended
knowledge domain to characterise the semantics of the dimension. Below,
the relevant markers may be found, dimension by dimension and divided
into lexical and constructional (see section 3.6.2 of <em>Knowledge
predication</em>).</p>
<div id="constructional-dimension-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Constructional Dimension 1</h3>
<p>The tables below show the markers correlated with Constructional
Dimension 1, i.e. the first dimension of a CMDS analysis of a distance
measure based only on <em>constructional markers</em>. First, the
markers <em>positively</em> correlated with Constructional Dimension 1
are given. In section 9.3.2. of <em>Knowledge predication</em> I analyse
these as being related to <em>achievement meaning</em>. This is followed
by markers <em>negatively</em> correlated with Constructional Dimension
1, which I analyse as being related to <em>state meaning</em>.</p>

<h3>Dimension 3</h3>
<p>Dimension 3 of the CMDS analysis is sensitive to the distinction
between <em>know that</em> and <em>know person</em>. In section 11.4, I
analyse this dimension as a tendency scale from <em>recognise</em> via
<em>know person (directly)</em> to <em>know person (indirectly)</em> to
<em>know that</em>.</p>

<h3>Dimension 5</h3>
<p>In section 9.6 of <em>Knowledge predication</em>, I analyse Dimension
5 as being sensitive to the distinction of lexical negation of
knowledge. Due to the interaction with negative modal forms, Dimension 5
is also to a degree sensitive to modal meanings. Markers which I analyse
as having lexical negation meaning are marked with an asterisk (*) in
the tables below.</p>
