Is it permitted to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay or should we not pay?\"","“You know that after two days the Passover takes place, and the Son of Man will be handed over in order to be crucified.”","\"Now learn the parable from the fig tree : Whenever its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near.","For all the nations of the world seek after these things, and your Father knows that you need these things.","So Pilate said to him, \"Will you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you, and I have authority to crucify you?\"","But his master answered and said to him, ‘ Evil and lazy slave ! You knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather from where I did not scatter seed.","And they began laughing at him, because they knew that she was dead.","Therefore be on the alert, for you do not know when the master of the house is coming — whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or early in the morning —","( They did not know that he was speaking to them about the Father. )","But they did not understand the statement, and they were afraid to ask him.","〚 But Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.\" 〛 And they cast lots to divide his clothes.","saying, \"˻ Leave us alone ˼, Jesus the Nazarene ! Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are — the Holy One of God !\"","No longer do I call you slaves, because the slave does not know what his master is doing. But I have called you friends, because everything that I have heard from my Father I have revealed to you.","( Now he said this to test him, because he knew what he was going to do. )","And he healed many ˻ who were sick ˼ with various diseases and expelled many demons. And he did not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.","Nathanael said to him, \"From where do you know me?\" Jesus answered and said to him, \"Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.\"","And he began to curse and to swear with an oath, \"I do not know this man whom you are talking about !\"","I know him, because I am from him and he sent me.\"","But the evil spirit answered and said to them, \"Jesus I know, [---]\"","[---] and Paul I am acquainted with, but who are you?\"","until another king arose over Egypt who did not know Joseph.","And you know the way where I am going.\"","Whenever he sends out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.","But he said to them, \"I have food to eat that you do not know about.\"","You know the commandments : ‘ Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honor your father and mother. ’\"","Jesus said to them, \"Are you not deceived because of this, because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God?","But he knew their thoughts and said to the man who had the withered hand, \"Get up and stand in the middle,\" and he got up and stood there.","If you understand these things, you are blessed if you do them.","For we are not writing anything else to you except what you can read or also understand. But I hope that you will understand ˻ completely ˼,","just as you have also understood us in part, that we are your reason for boasting, just as you are also ours in the day of our Lord Jesus.","So Philip ran up to itand heard him reading aloud Isaiah the prophet and said, \"So then, do you understand what you are reading?\"","But he denied it, saying, \"I neither know nor understand what you mean !\" And he went out into the gateway, and a rooster crowed.","And likewise also, the Spirit helps us in our weakness, for we do not know how to pray as one ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for uswith unexpressed groanings.","And as he was about to be brought into the barracks, Paul said to the military tribune, \"Is it permitted for me to say something to you?\" And he said, \"Do you know Greek?","For otherwise, if you praise in your spirit, how will the one who fills the place of the outsider say the \"amen\" at your thanksgiving, because he does not know what you are saying?","Hypocrites ! You know how to evaluate the appearance of the earth and the sky, [---]","[---] but how is it you do not know how to evaluate this present time?","And as they were getting out of the boat, people recognized him immediately.","And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he became invisible to them.","But I say to you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did with him whatever they wanted. In the same way also the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.\"","And recognizing Peter’s voice, because of her joy she did not open the gate, but ran in and announced that Peter was standing at the gate.","As a result, you will recognize them by their fruits.","And when he found out that he was from the jurisdiction of Herod, he sent him over to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem in those days.","So after reading the letter and asking what province he was from, and learning that he was from Cilicia,","And when he learned of it from the centurion, he granted the corpse to Joseph.","And when the brothers found out, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.","But when the crowds found out, they followed him, and welcoming them, he began to speak to them about the kingdom of God, and he cured those who had need of healing.","Now the large crowd of Jews found out that he was there, and they came, not only because of Jesus, but so that they could see Lazarus also, whom he raised from the dead.","And behold, a woman in the town who was a sinner, when she learned that he was dining in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster flask of perfumed oil,","But when they recognized that he was a Jew, they were shouting with one voice from all of them for about two hours, \"Great is Artemis of the Ephesians !\"","Then immediately those who were about to examine him kept away from him, and the military tribune also was afraid when he realized that he was a Roman citizen and that ˻ he had tied him up ˼.","[---]  and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple.
