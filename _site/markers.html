<h3>Constructional Dimension 1</h3>
<p>The tables below show the markers correlated with Constructional
Dimension 1, i.e. the first dimension of a CMDS analysis of a distance
measure based only on <em>constructional markers</em>. First, the
markers <em>positively</em> correlated with Constructional Dimension 1
are given. In section 9.3.2. of <em>Knowledge predication</em> I analyse
these as being related to <em>achievement meaning</em>. This is followed
by markers <em>negatively</em> correlated with Constructional Dimension
1, which I analyse as being related to <em>state meaning</em>.</p>
